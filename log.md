# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: February 11, 2019 
##### FreeCodeCamp: Javascript Algorithms + JavaScript30.com

**Today's Progress**: Finished ES6 and Regexp tracks. Made first JS thing - DRUM kit from [JavaScript30](https://javascript30.com/)

**Thoughts:** *ES6:* Figured out with arrow functions. Arrow Functions with parameters. At the beginning I didn't quite understand why and when we should to use Export Fallback with default export and import a default export, but examples helped. 
*JavaScript30 - first exercise:* Made JS script which can react to pressing buttons on the keyboard. 
Got experience in manipulating DOM elements with:
   - `addEventListener` 
   - `querySelector`
   - `querySelectorAll`
   - `classList.add` 
   - `classList.remove`

### Day 0: February 30, 2016 (Example 2)
##### (delete me or comment me out)

**Today's Progress**: Fixed CSS, worked on canvas functionality for the app.

**Thoughts**: I really struggled with CSS, but, overall, I feel like I am slowly getting better at it. Canvas is still new for me, but I managed to figure out some basic functionality.

**Today's Progress**: I've gone through many exercises on FreeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts** I've recently started coding, and it's a great feeling when I finally solve an algorithm challenge after a lot of attempts and hours spent.
