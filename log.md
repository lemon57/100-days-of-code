# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: February 11, 2019 
##### FreeCodeCamp: Javascript Algorithms + JavaScript30.com

**Today's Progress**: Finished ES6 and Regexp tracks. Made first JS thing - DRUM kit from [JavaScript30](https://javascript30.com/)

**Thoughts:** *ES6:* Figured out with arrow functions. Arrow Functions with parameters. At the beginning I didn't quite understand why and when we should to use Export Fallback with default export and import a default export, but examples helped.</br> 
*JavaScript30 - first exercise:* Made JS script which can react to pressing buttons on the keyboard. 
Got experience in manipulating DOM elements with:
   - `addEventListener` 
   - `querySelector`
   - `querySelectorAll`
   - `classList.add` 
   - `classList.remove`

Learned the difference: <br>
**Window** is the main JavaScript object root, aka the global object in a browser.<br>
**window.document** or just **document** is the main object of the visible (or better yet: rendered) **document object model/DOM**.<br>

### Day 1: February 12, 2019
##### FreeCodeCamp + [JavaScript30](https://javascript30.com/)

**Today's Progress**: Made the second JS thing - CSS + JS Clock from [JavaScript30](https://javascript30.com/).

**Thoughts**: 
*JavaScript30:* Ð¡ontinued to learn more deeply with JS functions for manipulating DOM elements? such as:
   - `querySelector`
   - `{jsVariable}.style.transform` <br>
Also mastered with:
   - `new Date()` JS function,
   - `transform` CSS property,
   - `transition` CSS property,
   - `transition-timing-function:` with `cubic-bezier` function <br>
   
Realy like manipulate HTML "clock" element - "mins-hand" with JS functions!

### Day 2: February 13, 2019

**Today's Progress**: I've gone through many exercises on FreeCodeCamp. Basicaly - Basic Data Structures.

**Thoughts**:
*JavaScript30:* Created new JS-CSS thing, today it was playing with CSS variables and JS. Found out how to change variables of properties img: `padding`, `background` and `filter`. <br> 
*Book:* Reading the book Bhargava A.Y. Grokking Algorithms is very interesting and understandable about algorithms and data structures. Got to know more about Hash table or simply Hash.<br> 
*FreeCodeCamp:* Learned how to manipulate arrays and Javascript objects using JS, as well as access and copy the information within them.<br>

### Day 3: February 14, 2019

**Today's Progress**: FreeCodeCamp. Basic Algorithm Scripting. And rummage in JS array functions.

**Thoughts**:
*JavaScript30:* Rummage in JS array functions, such as: filter, sort, map, reduce...<br>  
*Book:* Conntinue Read the book Bhargava A.Y. Grokking Algorithms.<br> 
*FreeCodeCamp:* Used a lot console.log() to log variable values to the console, when I got stuck. Vey usfull instrument to solve the problems. Solved a lot basic algorithms. Trained my Brain! :smile: <br>

### Day 4: February 15, 2019

**Today's Progress**: FreeCodeCamp. Basic Algorithm Scripting and Object Oriented Programming. JS30.

**Thoughts**:
*JavaScript30:* Creating flex panels image gallery. It was interesting to figure out how to make things on the page hide and appear.<br>
*Book:* just review last chupter about Data Structures.<br>
*FreeCodeCamp:* Continued to solve the basic algorithms. Ended this sections. Throw yourself into Object Oriented Programming in JS. <br>

### Day 5: February 16, 2019

**Today's Progress**: JavaScript30 - Ajax Type ahead.

**Thoughts & learning process:**:
*JavaScript30:* Learned how: <br>
   - fetch data from JSON and put it into Array, using *asynchronous function call* `then`,<br>
   - filter info from Array by `function filter` according to the request, <br>
   - display matches to html page, using for this:<br>
      - `regexp` <br>
      - `map function` creating new `<li>` elements on the page,<br>
      - `innerHTML` DOM element property - incapsulate info after filter function on the page. <br>
   - and of course use `document.querySelector` and `addEventListener`<br>
*Book:* today without reading :( <br>
*FreeCodeCamp:* reviewed some exercises from basic algorithms block<br>

### Day 6: February 17, 2019

**Today's Progress**: JavaScript30 - Array function part 2.

**Thoughts & learning process:**:
*JavaScript30:* Learned the following JS functions for array: <br>
   - `some` - is at least one person in array with certain conditions,<br>
   - `every` - is everyone in array with certain conditions, <br>
   - `find` - Find is like `filter`, but instead returns just the one you are looking for<br>
   - `findIndex` - Find the element in array with this ID <br>
*Book:* today without reading <br>
*FreeCodeCamp:* reviewed some exercises from Object Oriented Programming<br>

### Day 7: February 18, 2019

**Today's Progress**: FreeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts & learning process:**:
*JavaScript30:* just reviewed last lessons <br>
*Book:* today without reading <br>

### Day 8: February 19, 2019

**Today's Progress**: JavaScript30 - canvas HTML5 and check multiply checkboxes. FreeCodeCamp - Functional Programming.

**Thoughts & learning process:**:
*JavaScript30:* <br>
*First exercise - canvas HTML5:* <br>
Mastered following things: 
   - `canvas` - element is used to draw graphics on a web page,<br>
Learned properties that are used for `canvas` element:
   - `strokeStyle` - , <br>
   - `lineJoin`, `lineCap`, `lineWidth`, lineTo(), moveTo(), stroke(), beginPath() ... - <br>
Used `addEventListener` for drawing on the canvas, checking following events: <br>
   - `mousemove`, `mouseout` <br>
   - `mousedown`, `mouseup` <br>
*Second exercise - check multiply checkboxes:* <br>
   Understood the mechanism of selecting several checkboxes at once with the shift key. <br>
   Used for this: <br>
   - several `if` statements; <br>
   - `forEach` for looping through each checkbox, <br>
   - `shiftKey` and `checked` properties, <br>
   - and some helping variables: `inBetween` and `lastChecked` <br>
*Book:* today without reading <br>
*FreeCodeCamp:* reviewed some exercises from Object Oriented Programming<br>
