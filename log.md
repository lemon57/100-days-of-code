# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: February 11, 2019 
##### FreeCodeCamp: Javascript Algorithms + JavaScript30.com

**Today's Progress**: Finished ES6 and Regexp tracks. Made first JS thing - DRUM kit from [JavaScript30](https://javascript30.com/)

**Thoughts:** *ES6:* Figured out with arrow functions. Arrow Functions with parameters. At the beginning I didn't quite understand why and when we should to use Export Fallback with default export and import a default export, but examples helped.</br> 
*JavaScript30 - first exercise:* Made JS script which can react to pressing buttons on the keyboard. 
Got experience in manipulating DOM elements with:
   - `addEventListener` 
   - `querySelector`
   - `querySelectorAll`
   - `classList.add` 
   - `classList.remove`

### Day 1: February 12, 2019
##### FreeCodeCamp + [JavaScript30](https://javascript30.com/)

**Today's Progress**: Made the second JS thing - CSS + JS Clock from [JavaScript30](https://javascript30.com/).

**Thoughts**: 
*JavaScript30:* Ð¡ontinued to learn more deeply with JS functions for manipulating DOM elements? such as:
   - `querySelector`
   - `{jsVariable}.style.transform` <br>
Also mastered with:
   - `new Date()` JS function,
   - `transform` CSS property,
   - `transition` CSS property,
   - `transition-timing-function:` with `cubic-bezier` function <br>
   
Realy like manipulate HTML "clock" element - "mins-hand" with JS functions!

**Today's Progress**: I've gone through many exercises on FreeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts** I've recently started coding, and it's a great feeling when I finally solve an algorithm challenge after a lot of attempts and hours spent.
