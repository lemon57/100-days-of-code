# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: February 11, 2019 
##### FreeCodeCamp: Javascript Algorithms + JavaScript30.com

**Today's Progress**: Finished ES6 and Regexp tracks. Made first JS thing - DRUM kit from [JavaScript30](https://javascript30.com/)

**Thoughts:** *ES6:* Figured out with arrow functions. Arrow Functions with parameters. At the beginning I didn't quite understand why and when we should to use Export Fallback with default export and import a default export, but examples helped.</br> 
*JavaScript30 - first exercise:* Made JS script which can react to pressing buttons on the keyboard. 
Got experience in manipulating DOM elements with:
   - `addEventListener` 
   - `querySelector`
   - `querySelectorAll`
   - `classList.add` 
   - `classList.remove`

Learned the difference: <br>
**Window** is the main JavaScript object root, aka the global object in a browser.<br>
**window.document** or just **document** is the main object of the visible (or better yet: rendered) **document object model/DOM**.<br>

### Day 1: February 12, 2019
##### FreeCodeCamp + [JavaScript30](https://javascript30.com/)

**Today's Progress**: Made the second JS thing - CSS + JS Clock from [JavaScript30](https://javascript30.com/).

**Thoughts**: 
*JavaScript30:* Ð¡ontinued to learn more deeply with JS functions for manipulating DOM elements? such as:
   - `querySelector`
   - `{jsVariable}.style.transform` <br>
Also mastered with:
   - `new Date()` JS function,
   - `transform` CSS property,
   - `transition` CSS property,
   - `transition-timing-function:` with `cubic-bezier` function <br>
   
Realy like manipulate HTML "clock" element - "mins-hand" with JS functions!

### Day 2: February 13, 2019

**Today's Progress**: I've gone through many exercises on FreeCodeCamp. Basicaly - Basic Data Structures.

**Thoughts**:
*JavaScript30:* Created new JS-CSS thing, today it was playing with CSS variables and JS. Found out how to change variables of properties img: `padding`, `background` and `filter`.  
*Book:* Reading the book Bhargava A.Y. Grokking Algorithms is very interesting and understandable about algorithms and data structures. Got to know more about Hash table or simply Hash. 
*FreeCodeCamp:* Learned how to manipulate arrays and Javascript objects using JS, as well as access and copy the information within them.
